I had a supervisor that took a risk and let me write some VBA scripts that would take some of the old outputs and get them into modern analysis software. We ended up revamping our process and being able to replace the old 1950s hardware simulator with an updateable modern digital workflow. I trained my team on its use, and we treated it like a prototype for our developer to use for a more robust system.

It was wonderful. This job had everything, great people, IO psych, UI design via process improvement, coding, data analysis.
