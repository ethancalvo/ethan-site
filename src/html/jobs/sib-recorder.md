I was waiting to start pilot training and helping to investigate plane crashes. We did the same thing the NTSB does for plane crashes, but we did it for Air Force aircraft. I got to go out on two investigations, and they were both fascinating. Every kid waiting for pilot training should go do investigations beforehand.

This was also my introduction to IT. The LAN was small and simple, but a great confidence builder.
