I wasn't an app developer to begin with, but I was able to bump along and figure things out. It wasn't long before I started noticing processes within the company that could use a little web-dev-love. I created a few little tools to help automate things that ended up being fairly helpful. Fortunately my employers trusted me and gave me the freedom to try things out and grow.

I spent a lot of time working on php code within Joomla, our Magento store, and a local FileMaker database. Worked on iOS apps in ObjectiveC, Adobe Game Platform, and PhoneGap. I also started figuring out Node.js and writing Electron apps for internal tools that integrated with Adobe CEP plugins.

All of this set me up beautifully to later take advantage of the JAMstack.
