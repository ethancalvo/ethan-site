Originally hired at Logic of English to figure out iOS and Android apps.
I was the lone developer for the Logic of English Phonograms App and the Doodling Dragons app.

We also purched the source code for a Point of Sale app that I began customizing for use at curriculum conferences before we started using Shopify and their POS app.

During this time I also began an internal tool with an Adobe Indesign plugin to help format spelling lists for curriculum it helped curriculum authors widdle days of work down to minutes.
