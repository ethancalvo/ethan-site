I learned a lot about social science research in this job and began to build the confidence to suggest changes and help with their implementation.
It was in this job that I caught the development bug. In order to do good analysis of the large datasets I was looking at, I needed to write code to digest the data, clean the data, and prep the data for analysis. Automation became fascinating to me.

I found the idea of writing instructions for a machine to do my repetitive work much more attractive than doing the repetitive work. I also found that I came to understand the problems and the intricacies of the work better by writing my own data import and cleaning code.

I built a little personal database to help manage common questions and response scales. I also started writing some vba scripts to prep data for running more versatile analysis options using desktop analysis software.
