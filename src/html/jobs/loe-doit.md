I've had the opportunity to try my hand at quite a bit here. It's been humbling. There is so much I don't know, and all of it is interesting. Of course, some tech areas are more interesting to me personally than others. Fortunately, much of IT is a collection of solved problems, and I've been able to get something started and then outsource it's maintenance. My approach has been to outsource things that aren't especially unique to our company. For instance, I've outsourced device management, but hired a web developer to take over our web of marketing sites.

I've also come to appreciate the power of Saas options. The Air Force talked about concepts or technology as "force multipliers" that can make a small group of people comparable in power to a larger group. Saas options have been a huge force multiplier for us at Logic of English. They've helped me to hire slowly but develop solutions quickly. Good API design is a beauty to behold and work with, I've gotten pretty decent at sniffing out the gems that will integrate with the current portfolio.

My DoIT role has been a large exercise in keeping all the plates spinning. My goal is to make the employees feel like their tech is dependable and running buttery-smooth so they are free to create and help customers solve the literacy crisis in the United States.
