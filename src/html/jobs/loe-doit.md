I am currently happily employed as the Director of IT (DoIT - yes I got to pick my acronym, and I'm very proud of it) at <a href="https://www.logicofenglish.com">Logic of English</a>.

As DoIT, some of my main responsibilities include the following:

- LAN - the whole thing down to constructing the ethernet cables
- Backups - onsite and offsite
- Cloud back-office services - Google Worskspace, Atlassian, etc.
- Apple device administration - Mosyle is my favorite
- Custom internal software development
- I just handed the website off!
- My new favorite thing is mentoring other web developers and getting them ready to take over the world.
